## Flight Software that went onboard Sparc
FSW was developed for an ESP32 microprocessor! It's main task was to get sensor readings, decide the rocket's state and accordingly perform, Parachute ejection etc.
The FSW was built with a decent level of redundancy, where for every condition, a backup condition with less weightage had been defined! The Flight Computer had also been developed in such a way, that if a Sudden Power Loss occured, the FSW could function from the last known state, rather than beginning all of it's operations from the beginning! It was also developed to function even if a sensor or two fail. One of the main objectives was to store data onto the onboard SD card, as well as send it to the Ground Station in real time!
